- 📢 **Enhanced Discord Notifications**: Rich notifications with goal context and relevance reasoning
- 🗓️ **Multi-Site Monitoring**: Configure multiple sites with individual goals and schedules
- ⏰ **Randomized Scheduling**: Randomized intervals (4-6 min default) with concurrency control
- 🎯 **Smart Relevance Filtering**: Strict/loose modes with keyword matching and date awareness
- 🔧 **Text Scrubbing**: Configurable regex patterns to clean content before comparison
- 💾 **Organized Storage**: Per-site baselines in structured data directory
- 🚦 **Concurrency Control**: Configurable worker pool to manage resource usage
- 🛡️ **Error Resilience**: Graceful error handling with throttled notifications
- 📚 **Automated Booking Bot**: Schedule precise booking attempts with intelligent button detection
- 🕐 **Time-Based Execution**: Launch booking attempts at exact specified times

## Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url> visualwatch
   cd visualwatch
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   **Simple Multi-Site Setup (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Required
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook"
   
   # Just list your URLs separated by commas - that's it!
   WATCH_URLS="https://site1.com,https://site2.com/page,https://site3.com"
   ```
   
   The system automatically:
   - Creates smart site IDs from hostnames
   - Uses sensible defaults (4-6 min intervals, loose relevance mode)
   - Monitors the main content area of each page
   - Applies standard availability keywords

3. **Booking Bot Configuration (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Add these to your .env file for automated booking
   BOOK_URL="https://your-booking-site.com/reservations"
   BOOK_TIME="10:00"  # Time to execute booking (HH:MM format)
   PUPPETEER_HEADLESS=false  # Keep browser visible for manual completion
   ```

4. **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**
   For fine-tuned control, create a `sites.yaml` file:
   
   ```yaml
   # Optional global defaults (inherited by all sites)
   defaults:
     check_min: 4
     check_max: 6
     wait_until: networkidle
     headless: true
     watch_goal: "Alert only if there is new availability for the target date and party size."
     goal_keywords: ["available","availability","open","book","reserve","slots","seats","tables"]
     goal_negative_hints: ["sold out","fully booked","waitlist","notify"]
     relevance_mode: "strict"

   sites:
     - id: "pocket-concierge"
       url: "https://pocket-concierge.jp/en/restaurants/243892?extlink=pa-jp-ICS-PC_243892_HP_EN&date=2025-10-21&partySize=4&serviceType=DINNER"
       selector: "main"
       watch_goal: "Alert only if there is new availability for the target date and party size."
       goal_date: "2025-10-21"
       goal_party_size: "4"
       relevance_mode: "strict"
       scrub_patterns:
         - pattern: "\\bUpdated at\\s*\\d{1,2}:\\d{2}(:\\d{2})?\\b"
           flags: "i"
         - pattern: "\\s+"
           flags: "g"
   ```

4. **Run the Applications**
   ```bash
   # Website monitoring (main application)
   npm run dev
   
   # Booking bot (scheduled booking attempts)
   npm run book
   
   # Tock reservation bot (continuous monitoring for specific use case)
   npm run tock

## Production Deployment

### Using systemd (Linux)

1. Create service file `/etc/systemd/system/visualwatch.service`:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Visual Watcher (Puppeteer + GPT + Discord + Booking Bot)
   After=network-online.target

   [Service]
   WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/visualwatch
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm run dev
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5
   Environment=NODE_ENV=production
   User=youruser

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Enable and start:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now visualwatch
   sudo systemctl status visualwatch
   journalctl -u visualwatch -f
   ```

## Booking Bot Usage

The booking bot allows you to schedule precise booking attempts at specific times. It's designed to:

1. **Wait until the exact specified time** (e.g., 10:00 AM when reservations open)
2. **Launch the booking page** in a visible browser window
3. **Automatically click the "Book" button** when found
4. **Keep the browser open** for you to manually complete the booking process

### Example Usage

```bash
# Set up your .env file
BOOK_URL="https://resy.com/cities/ny/venues/example-restaurant"
BOOK_TIME="10:00"  # 10:00 AM today (or tomorrow if already past)
PUPPETEER_HEADLESS=false  # Keep browser visible

# Run the booking bot
npm run book
```

The bot will:
- Calculate the wait time until your specified booking time
- Launch the browser at the exact moment
- Navigate to your booking URL
- Search for and click booking buttons (supports Tock, Resy, and generic booking sites)
- Leave the browser open for you to complete the reservation

### Supported Booking Sites

The bot includes intelligent button detection for:
- **Tock**: Looks for `button[data-testid="booking-card-button"]` with "Book" text
- **Generic sites**: Searches for buttons/links with "book" in text or class names
- **Fallback**: Tries multiple common booking button selectors

## How It Works

1. **Staggered Multi-Site Scheduling**: Sites launch spread across 3 minutes (configurable) to avoid simultaneous requests
2. **Smart Concurrency Control**: Worker pool limits concurrent scraping (default: 3 sites max at once)
3. **Randomized Intervals**: Each site reschedules randomly within 4-6 minute windows after each check
4. **Smart Scraping**: Uses shared browser with per-site contexts and configurable text scrubbing
5. **Goal-Aware Filtering**: 
   - **Heuristic Check**: Fast keyword and date matching
   - **GPT Classification**: Deep relevance analysis (strict mode only)
6. **Intelligent Notifications**: Context-rich Discord messages with goal information and relevance reasoning
7. **Resilient Operation**: Error handling, throttling, and graceful shutdown

### Relevance Modes

- **Strict Mode**: Only notifies if heuristic passes AND GPT confirms relevance
- **Loose Mode**: Always notifies but includes heuristic results in message

### Notification Types

- 🔔 **Relevant Change**: Strict mode confirmed relevant change
- 🟡 **Loose Change**: Loose mode change with heuristic info
- 👀 **Baseline Saved**: Initial baseline creation (optional)
- ❗ **Error**: Processing errors (throttled to prevent spam)

### Concurrency & Timing Control

**Smart Staggering** prevents overwhelming target servers:
- **Startup**: Sites launch spread across `STAGGER_STARTUP_MINUTES` (default: 3 min)
- **Runtime**: Max `MAX_CONCURRENCY` sites scraped simultaneously (default: 3)
- **Intervals**: Each site reschedules randomly between `GLOBAL_CHECK_MIN` and `GLOBAL_CHECK_MAX` minutes

**Example with 5 restaurant sites:**
```
Site 1: Starts at 0.5 min  →  Next check in 4.2 min
Site 2: Starts at 1.7 min  →  Next check in 5.8 min  
Site 3: Starts at 2.3 min  →  Next check in 4.5 min
Site 4: Starts at 2.8 min  →  Next check in 6.1 min
Site 5: Starts at 3.1 min  →  Next check in 5.3 min
```

This ensures:
- ✅ No simultaneous requests to similar sites
- ✅ Natural, human-like timing patterns
- ✅ Respectful server load distribution
- ✅ Reduced risk of rate limiting or blocking

## Error Handling

- Network timeouts and browser errors are caught and reported to Discord
- Failed Discord webhooks are logged but don't stop the monitoring
- The watcher continues running even after errors, with automatic retries

## Cost Considerations

- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective analysis
- Heuristic pre-filtering reduces GPT calls in strict mode
- Truncates content to 6k characters to control API costs
- Only calls GPT when actual changes are detected
- Strict mode can significantly reduce API usage vs loose mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Selector not found**: The watcher will fall back to `main` or `body` if your CSS selector isn't found
2. **Heavy JavaScript pages**: The enhanced waiting logic includes `waitForSelector` with 15-second timeouts
3. **Rate limiting**: Adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` if you hit API rate limits

### Debugging

Run in non-headless mode to see what the browser is doing:
```bash
# In your .env file
HEADLESS=false
```

Enable verbose logging by checking the console output and Discord error messages.

## Quick Start Examples

### Super Simple (Just URLs)
```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook"
WATCH_URLS="https://restaurant1.com,https://tickets.site2.com,https://bookings.site3.com/calendar"
```

### Single Site (Legacy Compatible)
```bash
# .env file  
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook"
TARGET_URL="https://your-site.com"
CSS_SELECTOR="main"
```

### Advanced Multi-Site (YAML Config)
Create `sites.yaml` for fine control over goals, keywords, and scheduling per site.

## Migration from Single-Site Version

**Zero effort migration** - your existing `.env` continues to work exactly as before!

### Upgrade Options

1. **Keep as-is**: Single site monitoring continues unchanged
2. **Add more sites**: Just add `WATCH_URLS="site1,site2,site3"` to your `.env`
3. **Advanced tuning**: Create `sites.yaml` for per-site customization

### What's New After Upgrade

- **Multi-site monitoring**: Monitor 5+ sites easily with comma-separated URLs
- **Smart site IDs**: Auto-generated from hostnames (e.g., `github.com` → `github-1`)
- **Randomized scheduling**: More natural 4-6 minute intervals per site
- **Enhanced notifications**: Richer Discord messages with site context
- **Better resource management**: Shared browser with concurrency limits
